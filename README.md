## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

Before you begin, ensure you have Node.js (LTS version recommended) and npm (or yarn) installed on your system.

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/livestock-app.git
cd livestock-app
```

Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The app will run at http://localhost:5173

To create a production build:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command first type-checks the TypeScript code and then bundles the application for production. The output will be in the `dist` folder.

## üå≥ Project Structure

Here's an overview of the key directories and files within the `src` folder:

*   `src/assets`: Contains static assets like images, fonts, and icons.
*   `src/components`: Houses reusable React components used throughout the application.
    *   `ui/`: UI primitives and components, often from UI libraries like shadcn/ui.
    *   `layouts/`: Components responsible for the overall page structure (e.g., sidebars, navbars).
*   `src/contexts`: Holds React Context files for global state management (e.g., `AuthContext.tsx`).
*   `src/hooks`: Custom React hooks for encapsulating reusable stateful logic.
*   `src/lib`: Includes utility functions, Firebase configuration (`firebase.ts`), and other shared library code (`utils.ts`).
*   `src/pages`: Contains components that define the different pages or views of the application, mapped to routes (e.g., Dashboard, Livestock page, Farm management).
*   `src/main.tsx`: The entry point of the React application where the root component is rendered.
*   `src/App.tsx`: The main application component that sets up routing and global providers.

## üß™ Linting & Formatting

This project uses ESLint with TypeScript support for code linting and formatting consistency.

To set up ESLint and its dependencies, run:
```bash
npm install -D eslint @eslint/js typescript-eslint eslint-plugin-react-hooks eslint-plugin-react-refresh globals
```

The ESLint configuration is defined in `eslint.config.js` at the root of the project:

```javascript
// eslint.config.js
import js from '@eslint/js'
import globals from 'globals'
import reactHooks from 'eslint-plugin-react-hooks'
import reactRefresh from 'eslint-plugin-react-refresh'
import tseslint from 'typescript-eslint'

export default tseslint.config(
  { ignores: ['dist'] },
  {
    extends: [js.configs.recommended, ...tseslint.configs.recommended],
    files: ['**/*.{ts,tsx}'],
    languageOptions: {
      ecmaVersion: 2020,
      globals: globals.browser,
    },
    plugins: {
      'react-hooks': reactHooks,
      'react-refresh': reactRefresh,
    },
    rules: {
      ...reactHooks.configs.recommended.rules,
      'react-refresh/only-export-components': [
        'warn',
        { allowConstantExport: true },
      ],
    },
  },
)
```

You can lint your code by running:
```bash
npm run lint
```
